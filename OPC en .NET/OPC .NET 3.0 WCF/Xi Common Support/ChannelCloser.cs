	/// This class is used to properly close a WCF client proxy.  It aborts or closes
	/// the proxy based on the channel status and whether an exception is encountered.
	/// It has two calling methods, one where the proxy has a short life, and the other
	/// to be used when the proxy is held over the life of a single method.
	/// </summary>
	/// <example>
	/// Usage 1: Short lived proxy
	/// void SomeMethod()
	/// {
	///     SomeWcfProxy proxy = new SomeWcfProxy();
	///     using (new ChannelCloser(proxy))
	///     {
	///        proxy.MakeCall();
	///         ...
	///     }
	/// }
	/// 
	/// Usage 2: Long lived proxy
	/// void CreateProxy()
	/// {
	///     SomeWcfProxy proxy = new SomeWcfProxy();
	///     ...
	/// }
	/// void DestroyProxy()
	/// {
